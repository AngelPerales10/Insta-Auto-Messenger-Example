# InstaAutoMessengerExample
Small example to show how I would send Instagram messages via macros

This is just for demonstation purposes not for actual use. Your account will be banned if using this
as it is very much outdated and not the official version I created before (deleted with my other old business folders).

This is demonstrated with split windows.
On the left half would be settings, and chrome.
On the right half would be Notepad++ with the list of usernames to send messages to.
